# DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK

Objective:
The IoT Air Quality Monitor is designed to measure and display real-time air quality data using sensors and IoT connectivity. It will monitor key environmental parameters such as PM2.5, CO2, temperature, and humidity and send the data to a cloud dashboard for real-time visualization and historical analysis.

Key Features:
1.Real-Time Monitoring: Measures air quality parameters such as PM2.5, PM10, CO2, temperature, and humidity.
2.Cloud Dashboard: Sends data to an IoT platform (Blynk, ThingsBoard, or Firebase) for live and historical tracking.
3.Alerts & Notifications: Sends alerts when air quality exceeds safe thresholds.
4.Mobile & Web Access: Users can view data remotely via a smartphone app or web dashboard.
5.Data Logging & Analysis: Stores air quality data for long-term trend analysis.
6.Display Output (Optional): Shows real-time air quality data on an OLED or LCD screen.
7.Battery or Solar-Powered (Optional): Can be made portable with battery or solar power.

Components Required:
Microcontroller: ESP32, ESP8266, or Arduino with Wi-Fi
Sensors: PM2.5/PM10 Sensor (SDS011, PMS5003, or MQ135) – Detects particulate matter
CO2 Sensor (MH-Z19 or MQ135) – Measures carbon dioxide levels
Temperature & Humidity Sensor (DHT11/DHT22 or BME280) – Monitors climate conditions
IoT Platform: Blynk, ThingsBoard, Firebase, or MQTT for remote data access
Display (Optional): OLED, LCD, or LED indicator for real-time readings
Power Source: 5V USB power, battery, or solar panel (for outdoor use)

Working Principle:
1.The sensors collect real-time air quality data.
2.The microcontroller processes the data and sends it to the IoT cloud platform via Wi-Fi.
3.The user can monitor air quality live on a mobile app or web dashboard.
4.If pollution levels exceed thresholds, the system triggers alerts or notifications.
5.Data is logged for historical trend analysis and long-term monitoring.
